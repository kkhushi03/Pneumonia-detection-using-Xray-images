# Pneumonia Detection ü´Å

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images. It is deployed on Hugging Face using Gradio, offering a simple interface for users to upload X-ray images and receive predictions in real time.

## Key Features
- Real-time Prediction: Upload chest X-ray images to instantly receive predictions on whether pneumonia is detected or not.

- User-friendly Interface: The model is integrated with Gradio, making it easy to interact with and test the model via a web interface.

- Pretrained CNN Model: The model is trained on a large dataset of X-ray images, providing robust performance for pneumonia detection.

## Model Overview
- Model Type: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- Input: Grayscale images of size (299, 299, 1)

- Output: Binary classification - "Pneumonia Detected" (1) or "No Pneumonia Detected" (0)

- Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

## How to Use

- Once the Gradio interface is launched, follow these steps:

- Upload a chest X-ray image in .jpg or .png format.


- The model will classify the image and display either "Pneumonia Detected" or "No Pneumonia Detected".

- Input Image Requirements

-- Size: 299x299 pixels (resized)

-- Format: Grayscale (the model expects single-channel images)
